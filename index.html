    <h2>Things start out great</h2>
    <p>
      Greenfield projects are the <b>best</b>, right?
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
Starting a new project is one of my favorite things. So many things to
play with, so much to discover.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/charlie_bucket_with_golden_ticket.jpg" />
    <aside class="notes">
It's a gift to be able to work on something new. How many people here
have been on a new project in the last year? Ever?

How about a new or rewritten subsystem?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>It all made sense at the time</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
It's a gift because I've made none of my usual mistakes yet, or
encountered none of the troubling bugs, or run into difficult users,
or interfaced with other terrible systems, or eased into one of the
typical compromises.

All those things you do the more you're dirtied by the real world. And
you do them for good reasons that make sense at the time.
    </aside>

  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/oh_my_ive_done_it_again.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
So I will do all these things. And so will you. What's worse, I'll
get so caught up in the learning, and the sheer joy of productivity
that I won't remember all the painful lessons from past systems when I
did those things.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Does it matter why?</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/tumbleweed_blowing.gif" />

    <aside class="notes">
There are probably lots of reasons for this, but that's another
talk. The main one I want to talk about is our levels of abstraction
and some of the side effects of working with them at the right and
wrong levels.
    </aside>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>"agile" vs AGILE</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/au_lapin_agile.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
We all love "agile" (though not necessarily Agile). A good deal of
agile is geared toward making you the developer acutely aware of
everybody's joy and pain and tightening the feedback cycle between
your awareness of and influence on these things.
    </aside>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h2>Help others be awesome</h2>
    <p>...what we do is a means, not an end.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/spiders_from_cocoon.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
One of the main levers we have to do this technically is to make our
systems easier to change.

Easy to change increases the opportunity for empathy. Empathy was
common theme at devopsdays last week: empathy with our co-workers,
with other areas of the organization, with users.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Side effects</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      For the practices we'll discuss we'll also mention side
      effects. Sometimes they can be the main benefit, sometimes
      they're a risk or something to be mitigated, and sometimes the
      side effects can lead to other side effects, or enable other
      practices.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Lever 1: Feature flags</h2>

    <p>Setting controlling feature accessibility</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Who's using them?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      Timing features to releases is harder than you'd think,
      particularly the older and larger your system gets. (Yes, this
      is a good argument for lots of small systems. That's another
      talk.)
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/daily_wtf_dependency_graph.png" />

    <aside class="notes">
Dependencies usually aren't this bad (crazy graph), but they can be
tricky. Feature X may require an update to a database table but
Feature Y also needs to update it, and the updates need to be done at
the same time.

BUT Feature X needs to be one two weeks before Feature Y.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Thinking differently about features</h2>

    <p>Full functionality vs not breaking</p>

    <aside class="notes">
Instead of thinking of features as a discrete set of files
implementing a feature that get delievered (sory, "merged") at once,
what if it were a set of changes that get delivered over time -- maybe
even a long time -- but none of which break existing functionality?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Not the prettiest...</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      Most implementations can be kind of gross... See Kellan
      Elliott-McCrea's presentation on Change at Etsy for an
      example. (PHP, but still...)
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>I'll just code that up...</h2>
    <p>You don't have to! (Flip, Setler, Togglz)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      May even be able to use third party runtime A/B testing services
      for lightweight version.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>But I want clean!</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
      Having part of a feature's code released is okay! (Koan: is a
      feature even partially released if it cannot be used?)
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Happy side effects</h2>

    <p>Release more often; A/B testing</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Releasing more often is good in and of itself. But it also means
      you're releasing smaller changes, which are generally less
      risky. Lowered risk increases development experimentation. And
      that can bubble up the organization in great ways.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Related: Kill switch</h2>

    <p><b>Runtime</b> flag removing functionality due to
    disruption</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Credit card processor went down, some backend system has
      collapsed and we don't want to continue throwing traffic at it,
      etc. Results can be reduced functionality, or may even be hidden
      to user (orders are put into a queue and not touched).
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Example: Read-only system</h2>

    <p>Enabling schema change for broken databases</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      This could help you work around database shortcomings (MySQL
      5.5, how do substantial systems use this!?) by ensuring that you
      can keep your app up during blocking schema changes.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Side effects</h2>

    <p>&lt;discuss&rt;What actually happens when things
    fail?&lt;/discuss&rt; vs (shrug)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Most of the time these discussions are much better handled by
      other parts of the business, not you. Giving an easily
      understood hook into the ability to turn things off leads to
      discussions of what we should actually do when they're off.
