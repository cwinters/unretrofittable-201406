    <p>
      Greenfield projects are the <b>best</b>, right?
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
Starting a new project is one of my favorite things. Probably yours
too. People start new jobs just to do new stuff. So many things to
play with, so much to discover.

    <h2>It all made sense at the time</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Why awesome? No usual mistakes -- troubling bugs, difficult users,
interface with terrible awful systems, compromises work org, dreadful
assumptions, hidden agendas...

But... many are good ideas at the time! Nobody wants crap -- just

Lots of reasons, that's another talk. Now: our levels of abstraction,
side effects of working with right and wrong ones.

    <h2>"agile" vs AGILE</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/au_lapin_agile.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
We love "agile", maybe not capital A Agile. Lot of it geared toward
making developer acutely aware of all joy + pain, tightening feedback
between awareness and influence on them.

    <h2>Frying pan?</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/au_lapin_agile_rabbit.jpg" />
    <aside class="notes">
But you probably didn't sign up for people feedback loops, right? We have
analysts and product manager to take care of these things, right?
<br />
Nope, you're FULL STACK, baby. That includes the user.

TAB Hard to remember -- the means is fun! Argue about editors and
frameworks! But the end is what we get paid for.

    <h2>Change as change does</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/spiders_from_cocoon.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
Biology definition of "stable". We create complex systems. Not quite
life, but not bridges either.
<br />
Our main technical lever: make it easy to change.
<br />
...increases opportunity for empathy. Common theme at devopsdays last
week -- with co-workers, other organization parts, mostly with users.
    </aside>

  <section>
    <h2>Empathy? With what?</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Role of our systems in user's work / life
<br />
More: what users DO. Leads to assertion: Focus on tasks as organizing
abstraction will make your system better at what it does.
<br />
Thinking about tasks user POV not only happier users, clarity on new
feature focus.

    <h2>Also: side effects</h2>

Sometimes the main benefit, sometimes a risk or something to be mitigated,
and sometimes can lead to other side effects or enable other practices.

    <h2>Lever 1: Creating a usable system</h2>

    <p>One command to create a system with real(-ish) data.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      How can we manifest this empathy with the user?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/skepticalbaby.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
Seriously! Everybody ignores. Happy to limp along with data we've built up.
<br />
Show system to family: data real? real life user names? products have
generic photos? history -- was everything created the same day? what
happens when you run a report?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Hard part: real(-ish)</h2>
    <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">"But I have fixtures!"</p>
    <img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" src="lib/images/wat_emu.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
One command is easy. Hard part is looking real. TAB Oh, you have fixtures...?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Can your domain experts edit them?</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
Fixtures are bare minimum. Write once read never. Relational data
without SQL is awful. In YAML files? LOL
<br />
They work table by table. Because objects mapped to tables,
data flow directly into them.
<br />
THIS SHOWS THE PROBLEM.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Abstractions shape ideas</h2>

    <img src="lib/images/many_tables.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
Storage shapes how we present and think about our domain. How many
tools exist to navigate this path? How many apps have you seen that
just barf relations to user?
<br />
"They just make it easy" is problematic. People do what's easy.
    </aside>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>So many forms</h2>

    <img src="lib/images/wall_of_clipboards.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">

Example: hospital discharge nurse. Discharge is A Thing to her. To
you? One or two dozen tables. How to make that real?
<br />
How can you hope to rope domain experts like her into defining your
data for you?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Thinking in tasks</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Users don't think in normalized tables. Don't care about
efficiency, or query planners.
<br />
Do care about duplication, but less than you think. Do care about
completeness, doing very little mapping their brain to The System.
<br />
Our job to mediate between tasks and metal. But we focus on metal. Should focus on
tasks.  Metal is what we read, argue about, school for, care about.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tasks will cause you pain</h2>

    <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Fowler: "If it hurts, do it more often."</p>

    <aside class="notes">
This path is non trivial. Even painful. But this pain is good! Data
too complex and hard to recreate give pain early. Pointer to
dissonance between user view and your view. TAB Ideal world pain will
induce change, most often we callus up.
    </aside>

  <section>
    <h2>Side effects, you</h2>
    <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
      Quick startup for new hires or changing teams. Which means
      people can change teams more often!

    <h2>Lever 2: Audit</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/skepticalbaby.jpg" />
    <aside class="notes">
Seriously?! There aren't many terms that evoke enterprise software
more than "auditing".
<br />
TURNS OUT auditing has great first and second-order effects to make
lots of people (including you) happy.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>Why do you even?</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/nature_trail_eye_play.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
Answer "How did this thing get this way?" at any time. Who created it
with what data, who updated it and when? Can be invaluable for support
staff, though reciting back to a user her actions may be Big Brother
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cooler than it sounds</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
To outsiders: auditing adds determinism. Think about how nutty our
systems look to them. Auditing helps our crazy system finally MAKE
SENSE. Not just a bunch of people guessing or shrugging and offering
no help.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>More abstractions</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/tables_with_view.jpg" />
    <aside class="notes">
Most frameworks hook into persistence. Attractive: leveraging tool for
orthogonal concern -- a big reason we use frameworks!
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Refactoring resistant</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Can work ok, but resist refactoring. How to represent *logical* record
when history is tied to *physical* record and physical storage changed?
    </aside>
  </section>

<!--
  <section>
    <h2>X changes Y changes Z changes...</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Tricky to separate audited actions from side effects - for example:
Amazon gift card needs to + $ in cart, but also - $ from record. And
what if I only use part of the gift card and Amazon has to store the
remainder for later?
    </aside>
  </section>
-->

  <section>
    <h2>Record tasks, not results</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Traditional auditing: record results. What if we record actions
themselves?  Similar to loading data: reuse those ideas and attach
'who' and 'when' and 'from where' metadata about these actions.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What could we do with that record?</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
Not only auditing, but replay. Replay for load, replay for modified
business logic, replay for debugging to get back to a point in
time. Maybe replay done elsewhere to run through an expensive
computation (risk profile) -- see Fowler's article on LMAX.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Other side effects</h2>

    <p>Confidence in the system: things can be explained!</p>

    <p>Exposing intent -- <tt>RecoverPassword</tt>
    vs <tt>ResetPassword</tt>
    and <tt>SendPasswordRecoveryEmail</tt></p>

    <h2>Lever 3: Undo</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/keep_calm_and_click_undo.jpg" />
    <aside class="notes">
Lastly, we'll focus on an activity that's almost entirely end-user
focused. Undo.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/baby_fight.jpg" width="540" height="374" />
    <aside class="notes">
Users expect small undo, not large. Undo font change or typing: just exist.
<br />
Undo order? Hospital admission? Import a school of students?
<br />
MAGIC. The sort that users will LOVE YOU for. People flip out that
they can undo gmail deletions. What if they accidentally import a
spreadsheet of 500 students to the wrong school and that can click a
button to make it better?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Again with the tasks</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
But they expect undo of actions, don't care about side effects in your
system. Undo should mean it's like the action never happened. The form
went in the shredder, the file never uploaded.
<br />
Couple of tricks depending on action. Both easier to do at start.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Grace period</h2>
    <p>Wait a while to do your work, don't do it if asked</p>
    <aside class="notes">
I place an order, but cancel without consequence in the half hour
after. (Efficiencies in logistics can actually make this more
difficult, ask Amazon.
<br />
Simple on surface: do nothing until period up. I like doing nothing!
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>No free lunch</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/hedgehog_trying_to_escape_top_hat.gif" />
    <aside class="notes">
Actually: everything EXCEPT the final action. e.g., validation logic
must fire so user doesn't get "Order invalid" email half hour
later. Inventory needs to be up to date.
<br />
Tricky: validation dependent on earlier persistence. Transaction fix?
Maybe...
<br />
None of this is impossible, just easier if you have it in mind from
the beginning
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Change as Commands</h2>
    <p>Represent change as commands, represent undone change as commands</p>
    <aside class="notes">
Woohoo! Already user task abstraction. Great handle to UNDO
task. Commands that touch many you have to associate... but you've
already done! You want to treat it as A Thing and redisplay or enable
editing.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Side effects</h2>
    <p>Users can experiment! Less fear! So much happiness!</p>

    <h2>Lever n: Feature flags</h2>

    <p><b>Compile/build</b> setting controlling feature
    accessibility</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Compile/build is typical, not mandated; it speaks more to their
      typical scope.
      <br />
      <br />
      Who's using them?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      Timing features to releases is harder than you'd think,
      particularly the older and larger your system gets. (Yes, this
      is a good argument for lots of small systems. That's another
      talk.)
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src="lib/images/daily_wtf_dependency_graph.png" />

    <aside class="notes">
Dependencies usually aren't this bad (crazy graph), but they can be
tricky. Feature X may require an update to a database table but
Feature Y also needs to update it, and the updates need to be done at
the same time.

BUT Feature X needs to be one two weeks before Feature Y.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Thinking differently about features</h2>

    <p>Full functionality vs not breaking</p>

    <aside class="notes">
Instead of thinking of features as a discrete set of files
implementing a feature that get delievered (sorry, "merged") at once,
what if it were a set of changes that get delivered over time -- maybe
even a long time -- but none of which break existing functionality?
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Not the prettiest...</h2>
    <img src="lib/images/old_light_switches.jpg" />

    <aside class="notes">
      Most implementations can be kind of gross... See Kellan
      Elliott-McCrea's presentation on Change at Etsy for an
      example. (PHP, but still...)
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>I'll just code that up...</h2>
    <p>You don't have to! (Flip, Setler, Togglz)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      May even be able to use third party runtime A/B testing services
      for lightweight version.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>But I want clean!</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
      Having part of a feature's code released is okay! (Koan: is a
      feature even partially released if it cannot be used?)
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Side effects++</h2>

    <p>Release more often; A/B testing</p>

    <img src="lib/images/happy_chopsticks_eater.gif" width="418" height="360" />

    <aside class="notes">
      Releasing more often is good in and of itself. But it also means
      you're releasing smaller changes, which are generally less
      risky. Lowered risk increases development experimentation. And
      that can bubble up the organization in great ways.
    </aside>

  <section>
    <h2>You might also know me...</h2>

    <p><b>Runtime</b> flag removing functionality due to
    disruption, planned or not</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Credit card processor went down, some backend system has
      collapsed and we don't want to continue throwing traffic at it,
      etc. Results can be reduced functionality, or may even be hidden
      to user -- for example, orders are put into a queue and not
      touched but we can catchup later.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Wouldn't read-only be nice?</h2>

    <p><b>Why?</b> Enabling schema change for broken databases</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      This could help you work around database shortcomings (MySQL
      5.5, how do substantial systems use this!?) by ensuring that you
      can keep your app up during blocking schema changes.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Side effects</h2>

      <img src="lib/images/shrug.png" />
    </p>

    <aside class="notes">
      Most of the time these discussions are much better handled by
      other parts of the business, not you. Giving an easily
      understood hook into the ability to turn things off leads to
      discussions of what we should actually do when they're off.

  coding)</li>

  ID 4 in a ruby system...)</li>
      <li>Extract metrics via API: generic performance as well as performance
  specific for your app (Carol's example from devopsdays)</li>
